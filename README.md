# GenAI Docs

A centralized platform for exploring, understanding, and comparing Generative AI APIs—both public and private—through unified documentation, code examples, and dynamic updates.

## Overview

**GenAI Docs** makes it easy for developers, researchers, and product teams to:

- Browse and compare the specs of popular Generative AI APIs (OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
- Access standardized documentation, endpoint and parameter schemas, and real-world code examples (cURL, Python, JavaScript, etc.)
- Dynamically keep documentation up to date through automated crawling and a backend (Supabase) storage.
- Support private/self-hosted APIs (like vLLM, LMDeploy, etc.) by accepting Swagger/OpenAPI specs and generating interactive docs and code samples.

## Key Features

- 📖 Unified, human-friendly documentation for diverse LLM APIs
- 🔄 Automatic syncing and change detection (no manual re-deploy required)
- 🛠 Code examples for cURL, Python, JavaScript, and more
- ⚡️ Powered by Next.js (App Router) with Feature-Sliced Design (FSD) architecture
- ☁️ Dynamic schema and content loading from Supabase

## Project Structure

Follows the [Feature-Sliced Design](https://feature-sliced.design/) (FSD) methodology for scalable and maintainable code.

## Status

🚧 **Early development. Core structure and first components in progress.**
